Purpose: name scalar "constant" cells that call a `SourceData_*_Data` function and
route references to them through the new workbook-scoped name.

 missed the module-prefixed ones). `-Commit`. `-Backup`

- Target cell = formula is a SINGLE outer call to a `*_Data` function (module-dotted
  or bare) whose result is scalar (Value2 not array, not spilled >1, not `#error`).
  Excludes wrapped array displays like `Utility_DisplayArrayInTable(..._Data(), ...)`.
- Name assigned = BARE fn name (strip `Module.` prefix), workbook-scoped, RefersTo cell.
  No collision with the Excel-Labs LAMBDA name because that is `Module.Fn` (dotted).

## Key lesson: ApplyNames is SAME-SHEET only
Excel's native `Range.ApplyNames` does NOT rewrite cross-sheet references (all the
constant refs here are cross-sheet, e.g. `='Constants - Dairy'!$D$160`). So the script
rewrites references MANUALLY with regex:
- Qualified ref (any host sheet): `(?<![A-Za-z0-9_'])(?:'Sheet'|Sheet)!\$?COL\$?ROW(?![0-9A-Za-z_:])`
- Bare same-sheet ref (only on the source sheet).
- Range endpoints (address adjacent to `:`) are conservatively SKIPPED.
- Embedded refs are handled (e.g. `...!$D$221/100` -> `SourceData_..._Data/100`).
Dry-run computes new formula strings and reports old->new WITHOUT writing; `-Commit`
sets `$cell.Formula` and saves. Backup only when `-Backup` is set (one-time copy to
`Excel/Backups/Backup_PreName/`), OFF by default.

## Validated dry-run (2024, all workbooks)
98 cells named, 97 refs rewritten, 0 conflicts, 0 duplicates across 23 workbooks.
Each workbook internally consistent (different modules put constants at different rows,
e.g. Enteric Dairy D221=Fat vs ManureMgmt Dairy D227=Fat). NOT yet committed by default.
